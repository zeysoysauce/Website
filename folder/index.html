				<h3> Coding & Science classes</h3>
				<p class="skill-1-draw">
                    In school, we have IT classes. Coding 💻 is a good branch lesson in class I
				find it interesting and enjoy the lesson sometimes. It is kind of hard but when things are easy I
				find it easy. As for science class 🔬 , I want to be an aero-space engineer. Science is the main
				part to study in aero-space engineering. Science was kind of hard this year 🧪, but this year it
				seeked my attention 🧬. Although it was hard this year, I maintained the grades, I take science
				seriously.</p>

			<h3>Eating spicy food</h3>
			<p class="skill-2-food">I'm half Indian so.. I love spicy food. I'll eat any spicy food. The food in
				India is obviously spicy, every dish 🍲 I know are all spicy 🍛. Sometimes when me and my sister eat
				spicy food, we always challenge eachother where one wouldn't drink water 🚰 until the end and endure
				the spice 🌶🌶🌶. </p>

			<h3>Drawing</h3>
			<p class="skill-3-draw"> 
                I really like to draw. It's pretty interesting, but I'm still kind of new to
                it. I like to doodle on everything ✏ 😅. This summer when I have a lot of time,
                I'll practice drawing more ✍ and try be better at it. At the moment my drawings are decent but
                to improve I will try harder.  </p>
